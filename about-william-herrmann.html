                <p>
                    Exceptional engineer who began to learn software development best practices in
                    2013.
                    <span class="br"></span>
                    Have been putting concepts to practice by designing, writing, maintaining, and documenting systems
                    professionally since 2017.
                    <span class="br"></span>
                    Consistently recognized as a top developer and technical leader among peers.
                    Highly experienced with delivering efficient, effective, and cohesive systems across many
                    industries and wide-ranging projects.
                    <span class="br"></span>
                    Very accustomed to team-driven development in an Agile environment, 
                    but plenty of experience working solo in self-driven roles, 
                    especially as it comes to learning and teaching new technologies.
                    <span class="br"></span>
                    Happiest when working on the hard problems and making large-scale impacts.
