                <p>
                    My current role is a Senior Full-Stack Developer, although I was hired initially as a Full-Stack
                    Developer.
                    My responsibilities involve designing, building, and testing a wide variety of applications and
                    systems,
                    acting as a primary reviewer on pull requests, onboarding and training new and existing team
                    members, and
                    providing support across the organization with critical-thinking skills.

                <p>
                    My role at Radley mostly involved writing WCF service code which integrated with EF to provide an
                    API
                    for other client-focused developers, as well as supporting a WPF desktop application which was the
                    core
                    management UI for the ERP-esque product Radley provided to customers. In addition to these core
                    responsibilites,
                    I provided a great deal of technical knowledge across the organization and helped developers with
                    complex
                    code. Near the end of my tenure with Radley, we were in the process of migrating the WPF desktop
                    client
                    into an Angular web-based application.
