# willherr.github.io
My personal website. 

## Site Map

### [Will's Site](https://will-i-am.dev) 
[Source Code](https://github.com/willherr/willherr.github.io) | `vanilla html/css`

This is my main landing page. For now, I will be using it as an about/resume/project linking page.
The content below the navbar is an `iframe` of the [About Me](https://will-i-am.dev/about-william-herrmann.html) page.
  - I may do something else on this home page in the future.

### [Cassandra's Cookbook](https://will-i-am.dev/CassandrasCookbook) 
[Source Code](https://github.com/willherr/CassandrasCookbook) | `Blazor WASM`

This is a work in progress to migrate my wife's (Cassandra's) cookbook to be an only and easy to use and share version of it.
One day, I hope to put a database on the backend, instead of a JSON file to house the recipe data.

### [Will's Tools](https://will-i-am.dev/WillsTools) 
[Source Code](https://github.com/willherr/WillsTools) | `Blazor WASM`

A project dedicated to providing useful tools:
  - Randomizer
  - Counter
  - etc.

### [PoC](https://will-i-am.dev/Angular-RouteReuseStrategy) 
[Source Code](https://github.com/willherr/Angular-RouteReuseStrategy) | `Angular`

A proof-of-concept project to play around with caching components based on routing behavior.
