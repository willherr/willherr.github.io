# willherr.github.io
My personal website.

## Site Map
- https://will-i-am.dev (vanilla css and html)
  - This is my main landing page. For now, I will be using it as an about/resume/project linking page.
  - The content below the navbar is an `iframe` of the "About Me" page (https://will-i-am.dev/about-william-herrmann.html)
    - I may do something else on this home page in the future.
- https://will-i-am.dev/CassandrasCookbook (Blazor WASM)
  - This is a work in progress to migrate my wife's (Cassandra's) cookbook to be an only and easy to use and share version of it.
  - One day, I hope to put a database on the backend, instead of a JSON file to house the recipe data.
- https://will-i-am.dev/WillsTools (Blazor WASM)
  - A project dedicated to providing useful tools:
    - Randomizer
    - Counter
    - etc.
- https://will-i-am.dev/Angular-RouteReuseStrategy (Angular)
  - A proof-of-concept project to play around with caching components based on routing behavior.
